## Video calls

(Zoom, Hangouts, BlueJeans etc.)

<!-- Note -->
Next, I’d like to talk about video calls. Doesn’t matter what
technology you’re using. Could be Zoom, Google Hangouts, BlueJeans,
Jitsi, whatever.


#### Motivation for video calls <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The only reason to use **video calls** is to be able  
to **pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues.**

<!-- Note -->
There’s a very good reason to use video calls: they give you the
ability to pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues from the call
participants. But that’s really the only good reason to use them.

Video calls have a significant drawback: until we get reliable
automatic speech recognition and transcription, they are only
half-on-the-record. Hardly anyone goes to the trouble of preparing a
full transcript of a meeting, and if anything, we get perhaps a
summary of points discussed and action items agreed to. So even if we
keep recordings of every video call we attend, it’s practically
impossible to discern, after the fact, what was discussed in a meeting
_before_ decisions were made.

It is also practically impossible to _find_ a discussion point that
you only have a vague recollection of when it was discussed in a video
call, whereas doing so has a much greater probability of success if
a discussion took place on any archived text-based medium.


#### Every video call needs an agenda.

<!-- Note -->
This is, of course, true for any meeting, not just those conducted by
video call.


#### Meeting notes <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Until machines get intelligent enough to automatically transcribe and
summarise words spoken in a meeting, **write notes and a summary of
every meeting you attend,** and **circulate them.**

<!-- Note -->
If you think that video calls are any less work than chat meetings or
a shared document that’s being edited together or dicussed in
comments, think again. The only way a video call is less work, is when
everyone’s lazy and the call is, therefore, useless. Every meeting
needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate these notes not
only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with everyone who has
a need-to-know.


#### Meeting notes contents <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

1. Meeting title
2. Date, time, attendees
3. Summary
4. Discussion points (tabular)
5. Action items

<!-- Note -->

Putting an executive summary at the very top is extraordinarily
helpful so people can decide if they

* should familiarise themselves with what was discussed, immediately,
  and possibly respond if they have objections, or
* only want to be aware of what was decided, or
* just keep in the back of their head that a meeting happened, that
  notes exist, and where they can find them when they need to refer
  back to them.


### Video calls for recurring team meetings

<!-- Note -->
Using video calls for recurring meetings is a perfectly good
opportunity to feel the pulse of your team.

Obviously, a distributed team has *few* meetings, because they are
synchronization points, and we’ve already discussed that we strive to
minimize those. So the idea of having daily standups, sprint planning
meetings, and sprint retrospectives is fundamentally incompatible with
distributed teams. *Aside: in my humble opinion, this is also why
using Scrum is a terrible idea in distributed teams — not to mention
[that it’s a terrible idea, period.](https://youtu.be/f-ULT_Ic4qk)*

However, having perhaps one meeting per week (or maybe even one every
two weeks) in a video call is useful *precisely for the aforementioned
reasons* of being able to pick up on nonverbal clues like body
language, posture, facial expressions, and tone. If people are
stressed out or unhappy, it’ll show. If they are relaxed and
productive, that will show too.
