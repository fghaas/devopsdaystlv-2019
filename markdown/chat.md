# Text chat
(IRC, Slack, Mattermost, Riot.im etc.)


The only reason to use **chat** for collaboration  
is a need for **immediate, interactive mutual feedback.**

<!-- Note -->
Using interactive chat is a positively nonsensical idea for any kind
of communications _except_ the kind that requires immediate,
interactive mutual feedback from two or more participants.

This means that the only thing that chat is good for is communication
that is required to be *synchronous,* and remember, in a distributed
team *asychronicity* is the norm. So using interactive chat for
communications needs to be an *exceptional* event for a distributed
team; if it is instead a regular occurrence you’ll make everyone on
the team miserable.

For any interaction that does *not* require feedback that is *both*
immediate and interactive, email, a wiki, or an issue tracker are *far
superior* modes of communication.


The only reason to use **direct messages** for collaboration  
is a need for immediate, interactive mutual feedback  
**and confidentiality.**

<!-- Note -->
Using chat DMs as the *default* means of communication is utterly
braindead. In order for a chat DM to be useful, there is precisely one
clearly delineated confluence of events that must occur:

* You need immediate feedback from the other person,
* you need mutual back-and-forth with the other person,
* you don’t want others to follow the conversation.

I can’t emphasize enough that this combination is perfectly valid —
but it is *exceedingly rare.* If you want just a private exchange of
ideas with someone, encrypted email will do. If you want to work on
something together with one person before you share it with others,
restricted view permissions on a wiki page or an issue tracker ticket
will work just fine.

If you don’t need confidentiality but you do need interactive and
immediate feedback, chances are that you’re working on something
urgent, and it is far more likely you’ll eventually need to poll other
opinions, than that you won’t. So just use a shared channel from the
get-go, that way it’s easier for others to follow the conversation if
needed — and they might be able to point out an incorrect assumption
that one of you has, before you end up chasing a red herring.
