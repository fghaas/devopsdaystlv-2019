## Modes of communication in distributed teams

<!-- Note -->
A distributed team will habitually use multiple modes of
communication, relying mostly on those that make sharing, finding, and
contextualising information easy, and avoiding those that make it
difficult.


### Excessively using chat isn’t being efficient.
It’s being lazy. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
In many teams, distributed or not, using chat as a default mode of
communication is becoming the norm. This is **not** a symptom of
having a particularly dynamic or efficient team; it’s the
opposite. 

It’s a symptom of the worst kind of laziness: in an attempt to
communicate quickly and effectively, you are really making things
harder for everyone, including yourself.

<!-- Note -->
This is because, while *sharing* information in a chat is extremely
easy, it is also a “fire and forget” mode of communications. Chat
makes it difficult to find information after the fact, as anyone will
attest who has ever attempted to scour a busy Slack or IRC archive for
a discussion on a specific topic that they only remember to have
happened a “few months ago”. It’s even *more* difficult to read a
Slack discussion in context, that is to say in relation to *other*
discussions on the same topic, days or weeks earlier or later.

Let’s compare that to other communication modes:

* Email makes it easy to share information with a person or a group
  from the get-go, but quite difficult to loop people into an ongoing
  discussion after the fact. Finding information later is just as hard
  as with chat, and it’s marginally better at contextualizing
  information than chat (because you get proper threading).

* A wiki and an issue tracker (provided you don’t lock them down with
  silly view permissions), in contrast, both make it *very* easy to
  share, find, **and** contextualise information.
  
* Video calls are even worse than chat or email, because sharing
  information works but doesn’t scale — you can’t reasonably have more
  than 5-or-so people in a video call, and sharing the recording of a
  full video call is just pointless.

So really, make your wiki and your issue tracker your default mode of
communications, and use the others sparingly. (This isn’t meant to be
a euphemism for “don’t use them”, as we’ll get to in a moment.)
