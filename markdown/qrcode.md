<!-- Note -->
My slides are available on GitHub. As a courtesy to people less
comfortable with my English, the published slides include my full
speaker notes. They will advance in lockstep with my presentation
(if my internet connection permits it).

Also, you’ll see my Twitter handle on every slide here, so if you have
questions during the talk then please tag me in them, and I’ll get to
them at the end of the talk.
