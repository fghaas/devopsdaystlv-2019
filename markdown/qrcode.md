Scan me!

<!-- Note -->
My slides are available on GitHub. They will advance in lockstep with
my presentation (if my internet connection permits it).

Also, you’ll see my Twitter handle on every slide here, so if you have
questions during the talk then please tag me in them, and I’ll get to
them at the end of the talk.
