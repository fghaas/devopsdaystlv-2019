This is a personal talk. It does not claim to be rooted in statistical

* in a completely distributed company, that I founded, for 6 years,

* and now, for about a year and a half, I run a distributed team that
  is a business unit of a company that has existed for 15 years and
  throughout that time, has only ever worked from a single office.

So I think I might have seen and been aware of some of the rather
