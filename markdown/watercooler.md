## But what about the watercooler?

<!-- Note -->
The entirety of this talk, up to this point, has focused on
professional communications. And among people unfamiliar or
unexperienced with work in a distributed team, it is often accepted
that teams can communicate well “professionally.” 

However, they frequently ask, “what about watercooler chats? What about
the many informal discussions that happen at work while people are
getting some water or coffee, or sit together over lunch? There’s
always so much communication happening at work that’s informal, but is
extremely beneficial to everyone.”


### Office workers often don’t habitually externalise information.
A distributed team that tries that won’t last a week.

<!-- Note -->
Firstly, many companies where information exchange hinges on coffee or
cafeteria talk simply don’t give a damn about externalising
information. Sure, if 90% of your company’s knowledge is only in
people’s heads, you’re dead without the lunchroom. 

But if the same thing happens in a distributed team, it never gets off
the ground. So, if you have a team that’s functional and productive,
*because it habitually externalises information,* the absence of
chit-chat over coffee has zero negative impact on information flow.

However, you may also be interested in the completely non-work-related
talk that happens over coffee, that simply contributes to people’s
relaxation and well-being.


### People working in distributed teams are often introverts.
Or they simply choose to have their social relationships outside of work.

<!-- Note -->
I know this might shock some people, but there are plenty of people
who can make a terrific contribution to your company, but who dislike
the “social” aspect of work. They might thrive when being left
alone, with as little small-talk as possible, and ample opportunity to
socialize with their friends and family, away from work.


### You can still have informal discussions.

<!-- Note -->
But if you do have people on your team that enjoy having an entirely
informal conversation every once in a while, there totally is room for
that even in a distributed team. All you need to do is agree on a
signal that means “I’m taking a break and I’d be happy to chat with
anyone who’s inclined, preferably about non work related things” (or
whatever meaning your group agrees on). 

This could be

* a keyword on IRC,
* a message to a specific channel, or
* (if you want to get fancy) a bot that updates your group calendar
  when it receives a message with a particular format.

However, as a word of caution, I’ve actually done this with my team
before, and it didn’t catch on — for the simple reason that we almost
never took breaks that happened to overlap. But that doesn’t rule out
that it works on *your* team, and also there’s always the remote
possibility that two or more people on your team might like to
schedule their breaks concurrently.

What you can *also* do, of course, is have a channel in which you can
discuss completely random things that are not work related. And if the
rule is that confidential or company-proprietary discussion topics are
off-limits there, the channel might as well be public. It might even
be Twitter.
