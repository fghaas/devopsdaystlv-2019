## Briefing people

<!-- Note -->
Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an
important matter,** consider using a **5-paragraph format.**


1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

<!-- Note -->
This is a format as it is being used by many armed forces; in NATO
parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order. Now I’m generally
not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian life — after all
we shouldn’t forget that the military is an institution that kills
people and breaks things, and I say that as a commissioned officer in
my own country’s army —, but in this case it’s actually something that
can very much be applied to professional communications, with some
rather minor modifications. 


1. Situation
2. Objective
3. Plan
4. Logistics
5. Communications

<!-- Note -->

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are avaiable, and how
   they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.


“Please come back to me with your  
questions by 1500 UTC tomorrow”  
*is **far superior** to*  
“are there any questions?”

<!-- Note -->

People *always* have questions on what they’ve just been briefed
about. They just might not think of them straight away. Give people
time to think through what you’ve just briefed them on, and they will
think of good questions. So always have a follow-up round at a later
time (2 hours later, the following day, whatever), for which you
*encourage* your group to come back with questions.

Also, use that same follow-up for checking how your briefing came
across, by gently quizzing people with questions like

* “by what date do we want to implement X?”, or
* “Joe, what things will you need to coordinate with Jane on?”

This gives you valuable feedback on the quality of your briefing: if
your team can’t answer these questions, chances are that you weren’t
as clear as you should have been.
