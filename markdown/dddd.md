The **amount of incoming information** in a distributed team  
can be **daunting.**


Consider using the **“four-D” approach**  
when dealing with incoming information.

(Hat tip to David Allen)


* Drop
* Delegate
* Defer
* Do

<!-- Note -->
* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  *them*, and make a note for follow-up.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing *immediately*. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done *by you, and immediately.*

Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.


Tasks without follow-up and follow-through are a waste of people’s
time.
