#### The **amount of incoming information** in a distributed team can be **daunting.**

<!-- Note -->
When you work in a distributed team, since everyone is on their own
schedule and everything is asynchronous, you may be dealing with a
constant incoming stream of information — from your colleagues, your
reports, your manager, your customers. 

There is no way to change this, so what you need to do is apply your
own structure to that stream. What follows is not **the** way to do
that, but *one* way, and you may find another works better for
you. But you will need to define and apply *some* structure, otherwise
you’ll feel constantly overwhelmed and run the risk of burning out.


Consider using the **“four-D” approach**  
when dealing with incoming information.

(Hat tip to David Allen)


#### Four-D actions

Drop <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Delegate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Defer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Do <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
There is an approach that was popularized by David Allen, the author
of *Getting Things Done.* (I have no idea whether he *invented* this
approach; others may have come before him.) He suggests to apply one
of the following four actions to any incoming bit of information:

* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  *them*, and make a note for follow-up.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing *immediately*. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done *by you, and immediately.*

Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.


### “Drop” rules

Archive, don’t delete <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Keep archived information retrievable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Think about things you don’t understand <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
TODO


### “Delegate” rules

Find the right person <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Send them **all** the information <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Follow up and follow through <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
TODO


Tasks without **follow-up** and **follow-through**  
are a waste of people’s time.

<!-- Note -->
Do not delegate, or even define, tasks that you are not prepared to
follow through on. If you handwave “everyone use encrypted email from
now on,” and you’re not even prepared to make that work for your own
email account, you might as well just leave it.

And if you do proclaim an objective or rule and *then* you find yourself
unable to see it through — *this happens,* and is no sign of
ineptitude or failure — then loudly and clearly rescind it. It’s far
better for you to visibly backtrack, than to be perceived as someone
whose pronouncements are safe to ignore.


### “Defer” rules

Set aside <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Prioritize later <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Make sure you pick back up  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
TODO


### “Do” rules

Tell people <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

No interruptions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Plow through  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
