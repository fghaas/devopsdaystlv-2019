## Pinching the firehose

<!-- Note -->
Finally, I want to say a few words about what I like to call pinching
the figurative firehose you might otherwise be forced to drink from:


### The amount of incoming information in a distributed team can be daunting.

<!-- Note -->
When you work in a distributed team, since everyone is on their own
schedule and everything is asynchronous, you may be dealing with a
constant incoming stream of information — from your colleagues, your
reports, your manager, your customers. 

There is no way to change this, so what you need to do is apply your
own structure to that stream. What follows is not **the** way to do
that, but *one* way, and you may find another works better for
you. But you will need to define and apply *some* structure, otherwise
you’ll feel constantly overwhelmed and run the risk of burning out.


### Four-D approach <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Consider using the **“four-D” approach**  
when dealing with incoming information.

(Hat tip to David Allen)

<!-- Note -->
There’s a defined approach for doing this, which I learned about from
reading [David
Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author))’s [Getting
Things
Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done). I
don’t know if Allen invented the 4-D approach or whether someone came
up with it before him, but that’s how I know about it.


### Four-D actions

Drop <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Delegate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Defer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Do <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
In his book, David Allen suggests to apply one of the following four
actions to any incoming bit of information:

* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  *them*, and make a note for follow-up.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing *immediately*. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done *by you, and immediately.*

Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.


### “Drop” rules

Archive, don’t delete <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Keep archived information retrievable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Think about things you don’t understand <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
“Dropping” things doesn’t mean ignoring them. You still have to read
and understand what’s in them, and be able to find them later. So:

* Never delete things (except spam).

* Only archive them in a way that that keeps them retrievable in the
  future.

* If there something isn’t understandable to you, think it through and
  look for clarification.


### “Delegate” rules

Find the right person <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Send them all required information <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Ask for acknowledgment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Follow up and follow through <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Delegation obviously requires that there is a person you can delegate
to. This is *not necessarily* someone who reports to you; indeed, it
might be someone **you** report to. (You might be asked to deal with
something that you have no control over, but your manager does.) So:

* Find the right person that can get the task done.

* Preemptively send them **all** the information that you think they
  might need (and that you have access to), rather than relying on
  them to ask.

* Ask them to acknowledge that they have received what they need.

* Make a note to follow up to see if they need anything else, and
  follow through by seeing the task to completion.

Within your own team, **you only ever delegate tasks, not
responsibility.**


#### Tasks without follow-up and follow-through are a waste of people’s time.

<!-- Note -->
Do not delegate, or even define, tasks that you are not prepared to
follow through on. If you handwave “everyone use encrypted email from
now on,” and you’re not even prepared to make that work for your own
email account, you might as well just leave it.

And if you do proclaim an objective or rule and *then* you find yourself
unable to see it through — *this happens,* and is no sign of
ineptitude or failure — then loudly and clearly rescind it. It’s far
better for you to visibly backtrack, than to be perceived as someone
whose pronouncements are safe to ignore.


### “Defer” rules

Set aside <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Prioritize later <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Make sure you pick back up  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Deferring simply means that because something you need to do doesn’t
need doing *immediately,* you can do it at a time that suits your
schedule.

This means that you’ll need to

* add the task immediately to some sort of queue (for email, this can
  be a folder named “Needs Reply”),

* make sure to go through that queue at a later time to prioritize
  (ideally, right after you’re done with your “Do” tasks, which we’ll
  get to in a second),

* absolutely ensure that you make time to go back and actually do your
  prioritized tasks, at a time you consider convenient.


### “Do” rules

Tell people <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

No interruptions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Plow through  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
And finally, there’ll be your “Do” tasks — stuff that *you* need to
do, and do immediately.

* Tell people that you’re doing them, because you’ll want to be
  uninterrupted. Update your chat status, put some blocked time in
  your calendar.

* Make sure you’ll be uninterrupted. For email, turn off all your
  notifications.
  
* Plow through all the undropped, undelegated,
  undeferred items in your inbox until it’s empty.
